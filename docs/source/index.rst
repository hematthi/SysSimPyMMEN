Welcome to SysSimPyMMEN's documentation!
========================================

**SysSimPyMMEN** is a framework for inferring the MMEN from the SysSim models.

**`SysSim <https://github.com/ExoJulia/ExoplanetsSysSim.jl>`_** -- a comprehensive forward modeling framework for studying planetary systems based on the *Kepler* mission. In particular, `SysSimExClusters <https://github.com/ExoJulia/SysSimExClusters>`_ provides clustered planetary system models that characterize the underlying occurrence and intra-system correlations of multi-planet systems.

**Py** -- this package is written almost entirely in Python 3. This is unlike the SysSim codebase which is written in `Julia <https://julialang.org>`_.

**MMEN** -- short for "minimum-mass extrasolar nebula". This is the idea of a power-law profile for the minimum mass in disk solids required to form the existing exoplanets, if they formed in their present locations (*in situ* formation).
